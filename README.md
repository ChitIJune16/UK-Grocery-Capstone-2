## UK-Grocery-Capstone-2

### Project Overview
This project analyzes UK grocery retail sales to determine how price and distribution breadth impact unit sales in brick-and-mortar stores.
Because grocery retailers operate with fixed, limited shelf space, increasing unit movement is essential to maximizing sales and space productivity.
Using a structured machine-learning workflow—Data Wrangling → EDA → Pre-Processing → Modeling → Predictions—the project identifies which levers most effectively drive unit sales for top-selling items.
Key Outcomes:
Distribution is the strongest driver of unit sales.  +10% distribution → +8.64% unit lift
Price changes have minimal effect on most items  –10% price → +1.18% unit lift
Random Forest delivered the highest predictive accuracy
Business implication:
Retailers should prioritize increasing distribution coverage for high-value items rather than broad price reductions.
